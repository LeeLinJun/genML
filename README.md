Generate machine learning scripts with other languages
## Methodology
Since the most popular machine learning platforms provides imperative APIs for researchers to implement algorithms and models conveniently, trying to generate those (python) scripts with other powerful languages are quite natrual. In this respository, FP languages including racket and haskell will be used to realize the blue print mentioned before.
